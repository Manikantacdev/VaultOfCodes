    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in Web Development, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning. My goal is to build impactful, data-driven digital solutions that not only look great but also deliver real value through smart insights and automation.

As a Web Developer, I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly websites and web apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React. I focus on clean code, strong UI/UX principles, and performance optimization.<br><br>

My passion for Data Analysis drives me to work with tools like Python, Pandas, Excel, and SQL to extract insights, visualize trends, and support better decision-making. I'm comfortable analyzing real-world data sets and communicating findings effectively.<br><br>

I'm also diving deep into Machine Learning, exploring models for classification, regression, and computer vision. Iâ€™ve worked on small ML projects using libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and NumPy, and Iâ€™m eager to apply AI to solve practical problems.

I believe that combining these skill sets enables me to build full-stack, intelligent solutions â€” from intuitive front-end interfaces to predictive analytics under the hood.<br><br>

ðŸš€ Skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, Pandas, SQL, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Git, Data Visualization<br><br>
ðŸ“¬ Letâ€™s connect â€” Iâ€™m always open to collaboration, learning, and new challenges!

      <h3>Rice Leaf Detection</h3>
      <p>A Rice Leaf Detection website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Machine Learning.The Rice Leaf Detection website is a user-friendly platform designed to help farmers and agricultural experts identify diseases in rice plants through leaf analysis. By uploading images of rice leaves, users can receive instant feedback about potential issues such as bacterial blight, brown spots, or leaf smut. The website uses image processing and machine learning techniques to detect diseases early, enabling timely treatment and improving crop health and yield. This tool supports smarter, technology-driven farming for better agricultural outcomes.</p>
